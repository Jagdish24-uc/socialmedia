## Key Features:

1. User Authentication: The app has a robust user authentication system, ensuring that users can create accounts, log in securely, and protect their data.

2. Real-time Updates: We've integrated Firebase Firestore to provide real-time updates for the main content feed. This means that when someone likes, comments, or shares a post, it's instantly reflected for all users.

3. Content Feed: Users can scroll through a content feed that displays posts from other users. They can like, comment, and share posts.

4. Profile Management: Users have profiles where they can upload a profile picture, update their bio, and see their own posts.

5. Navigation: The app includes easy navigation with a sidebar menu that allows users to access different sections, such as the main feed, their own posts, and messages.
